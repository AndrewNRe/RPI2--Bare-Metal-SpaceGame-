A: Change the code to follow my current code style.
-Change all structs to be lowercase
-Change all function names to be uppercase.
-Reduce code duplication.
-Get rid of all globals except maybe memory dependent on what you want to do there. It's in the game code layer, so the way you do memory will be the same on all 
platforms in this case. As such, I think doing something more robust, or requiring that you have a memory structure per allocation would be best.

Before B: Should look into the weird Z bug, surely just something with the Z division and my misunderstanding of something related to that and what not.

B: "multithread" the software renderer.
-Need to ensure that I can use the other 3 cores.
-Need a way to break the framebuffer up into chunks.
-What are the boundary lines for how large a chunk can be? I don't want one thread to write to the framebuffer and cause some cpu cache flush or what not.
-Is the previous statement relevant? Absolutely need to read on this.
-Need to get some queue to issue out work to all the threads. Thinking that a lot of rework on the engine will be done to make this happen!

C: Correct GJK to be more correct.
-Refer to Haunt code if this is me doing this implement.
-If someone else is doing this, the video I used to understand GJK was Casey Muratori's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qupqu1xe7Io

F: Should go and reduce register count on render letters. I was just simply tired and lazy the day I originally wrote it and don't have time today (4/12/21)!
Also, should make it so the render routine stores a buffer and just pushes all render letters in a render letter pass to draw on top of everything in the game!

It would appear that the best way to solve the bug is to not transform the box at all. But instead, move the player by the inverse trasnform of the box and then test against the normals as
I currently have all that math working.
