Optional:
A: "multithread" the software renderer.
-Need to ensure that I can use the other 3 cores.
-Need a way to break the framebuffer up into chunks.
-What are the boundary lines for how large a chunk can be? I don't want one thread to write to the framebuffer and cause some cpu cache flush or what not.
-Is the previous statement relevant? Absolutely need to read on this.
-Need to get some queue to issue out work to all the threads. Thinking that a lot of rework on the engine will be done to make this happen!

B: Should go and reduce register count on render letters. I was just simply tired and lazy the day I originally wrote it and don't have time today (4/12/21)!
Also, should make it so the render routine stores a buffer and just pushes all render letters in a render letter pass to draw on top of everything in the game!
