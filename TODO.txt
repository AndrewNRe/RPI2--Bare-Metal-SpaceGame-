A: Change the code to follow my current code style.
-Change all structs to be lowercase
-Change all function names to be uppercase.
-Reduce code duplication.
-Get rid of all globals except maybe memory dependent on what you want to do there. It's in the game code layer, so the way you do memory will be the same on all 
platforms in this case. As such, I think doing something more robust, or requiring that you have a memory structure per allocation would be best.

B: "multithread" the software renderer.
-Need to ensure that I can use the other 3 cores.
-Need a way to break the framebuffer up into chunks.
-What are the boundary lines for how large a chunk can be? I don't want one thread to write to the framebuffer and cause some cpu cache flush or what not.
-Is the previous statement relevant? Absolutely need to read on this.
-Need to get some queue to issue out work to all the threads. Thinking that a lot of rework on the engine will be done to make this happen!

C: Correct GJK to be more correct.
-Refer to Haunt code if this is me doing this implement.
-If someone else is doing this, the video I used to understand GJK was Casey Muratori's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qupqu1xe7Io

D: Fix the math of either the perspective projection matrix, and also just the general space math as I know it's gotta be wrong due to rotations rotating about the 
world origin from what it looks like atm.

E: Don't store full sets of vertex / index data for N temple platforms. You should just store a position and only one instance of the mesh! //As of 3/27/21, 
//this is partially done. Still have a bit to go on it though. Mostly just have to rework the entire platform render / player system so game code and such.


Currently working on 4/3/21:
-Figure out why the triangle is going up and to the left!
